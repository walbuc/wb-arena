title: Full Stack Ts ðŸ¤¯
---

### Background

Ts is awesome for static analysis but we have some boundaries that Ts can not
infer the correct type for our app values. One of those boundaries are HTTP API
requests.

If there is a change in type in the backend and I use that in the frontend, I
want to catch that error with ts static analysis and be type safe.
