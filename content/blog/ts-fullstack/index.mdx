title: Full Stack Ts ðŸ¤¯
---

### Background

Ts is awesome for static analysis but we have some boundaries that Ts can not
infer the correct type for our app values. One of those boundaries are HTTP API
requests.

If there is a change in type in the backend and I use that in the frontend, I
want to catch that error with ts static analysis and be type safe.

#### Tips

In ts if you pre some variable with \_ (underscore) Ts wont warn you if it is
not used.

In Ts everything is required and you need to indicate if some property if
optional. In GraphQL everything is optional and you need to indicate if
something is requried.

#### Typing Resolvers

Generate Ts code based on a GraphQl Schema. In Server folder `yarn codegen`

In client folder same comand after creatin gql queries mutations `yarn codegen`

You can configure gql-cg to instrospect types in the backend and frontend.
[graphql code generator](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/codegen)

in the frontend code it will return typed functions (use hooks) that can be
called.

Guardrails are up. One set of assumptions & constraints, UI, Backend and DB are
operating under the same set of assumptions defined in one file.

#### N+1 Problem:

Excessive quering.

#### Transforms: Mapping between DB schema to GraphQL schema.
