Write tests, not too many. Mostly integrations. Try to mock as little as
possible.

### Recomnendations for Remix testing

- Unit tests loaders and action (see
  https://sergiodxa.com/articles/test-remix-loaders-and-actions)
- Test with RTL any component not depending on Remix hooks or components (they
  need a context that you donâ€™t have access to work)
- Use Cypress to do E2E tests to test whole routes
- Also check #372
