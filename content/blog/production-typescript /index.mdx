### Benefits:

- A programming language, a compiler and a language server
- A syntactic superset of JavaScript
- The core of the best JS environment available today
- "A fancy linter", and a fantastic static analysis tool

### Working with Typescript & problems tries to solve

- Duck typed languages start to hurt more as codebases get large
- Informal contracts grow organically, formal ones grow deliberately
- JS authoring environments are worlds behind the UX of "modern IDEs"
- Too many JS
