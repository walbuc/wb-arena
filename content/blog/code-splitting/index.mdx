  Code splitting feature in bundlers like webpack can help you boost your app
  performance.

### Background

Code splitting acts on the principle that loading less code will speed up your
app. Say for example that we're building a complex dashboard application that
includes the venerable d3 library for graphing data. Your users start
complaining because it takes too long to load the login screen.

Webpack built in code splitting with dynamic import.

```javascript
import('/some-module.js').then(
  module => {
    // do stuff with the module's exports
  },
  error => {
    // there was some error loading the module...
  },
)
```

### Eager Loading

After the first time it will be cached in wepack module cache.

```jsx

const loadGlobe = () => import('../globe')
const Globe = React.lazy(loadGlobe)

function App() {
  ...
    >
      <label
        style={{marginBottom: '1rem'}}
        onMouseEnter={loadGlobe}
        onFocus={loadGlobe}
      >
    ...
```

### React Example

With prefetch / preload

```jsx
const Prefetched = React.lazy(() =>
  import(
    /* webpackPrefetch: true */
    /* webpackChunkName: "prefetched" */
    './prefetched'
  ),
)
const Preloaded = React.lazy(() =>
  import(
    /* webpackPreload: true */
    /* webpackChunkName: "preload" */
    './preloaded'
  ),
)

function Main() {
  const [show, setShow] = React.useState(false)
  return (
    <React.Suspense fallback="...">
      <button onClick={() => setShow(true)}>Show</button>
      {show ? (
        <div>
          <DepsIncluded />
          <One />
          <Two />
          <Prefetched />
          <Preloaded />
        </div>
      ) : null}
    </React.Suspense>
  )
}
```
