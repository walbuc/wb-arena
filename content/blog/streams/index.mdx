A stream is an abstract interface for working with streaming data in  
 Node.js.

That means you can consume data as it is loaded or produced, chunk by  
 chunk (or piece by piece), instead of getting it all into memory to start  
 consuming it.

Streams can be readable, writable, or both.

There are four types of streams:

» Readable stream, which data can be read.  
 » Writable stream, which data can be written.  
 » Duplex stream, which is both Readable and Writable.  
 » Transform stream, which is a Duplex stream that can modify or  
 transformthe data as it is written and read.
