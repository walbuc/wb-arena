title: Fusion ⚡️
description: Using fusion technique
---

Fusion is a technique of combining pure functions — taking advantage of
composition and removing the intermediary copies of data on each layer.

### Fusion Example

- This utility function is often available on various functional libraries (i.e
  ramdajs) Lodash
- `pipe` is the opposite of `compose` left to right instead of rifht to left

```js
const data = [ 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ];
const pipe = (...fns) => initialValue => fns.reduce((result, fn) =>
fn(result), initialValue);

const add = (x) => x + 1;
const multiplyBy2 = (x) => x \* 2;

const res = data .map( pipe(add, multiplyBy2) )
 [ 4, 6, 8, 10, 12 ]
```
